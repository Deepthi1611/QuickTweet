    # All the URLs provided by Django's authentication system will be prefixed with accounts/
    # By adding this line, you are essentially linking the built-in authentication system to your project.
    # This line in urls.py is what actually provides the URL patterns and views for login, logout, password reset, and other authentication features.
    # Without this, Django wonâ€™t know where to find the views for logging in or logging out, and you'll get a "Page Not Found (404)" error
